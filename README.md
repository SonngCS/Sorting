# Sorting

Here I have some projects involving sorting algorithms.

# Sorting Choice

Sorting choice is a small project gathering all the sorting algorithms I learned in college, the algorithms learned in class were reproduced and put together in a program that lets you generate a vector and choose a function to sort it. The timer in the code was based on: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/459691/best-timing-method-in-c

OBSERVATIONS: The program currently isn't finished and the idea is to modify "printHeap" in print.h to show the entire heap in a binary tree shape
